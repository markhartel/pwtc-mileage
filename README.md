# PWTC Mileage 
This is a Wordpress plugin used to record, manage and report the mileage of riders in the [Portland Wheelmen Touring Club](http://pwtc.com).

## Installation
Download this distribution as a zip file, login to the pwtc.com Wordpress website as 
admin and upload this zip file as a new plugin. This plugin will be named **PWTC Mileage**,
activate it from the Plugins management page. After activation, this plugin will create
five new tables and twelve new views in the Wordpress database. A **Rider Mileage** menu group
will be added to the admin menu bar and shortcodes created to allow you to add mileage-related 
content to your pages. A new user role named **statistician** will be created to allow 
a user access to the **Rider Mileage** menu group pages.
### Plugin Uninstall
Deactivate and then delete the **PWTC Mileage** plugin from the Plugins management page.
Normally, the **PWTC Mileage** database tables and views will **not** be dropped. To
force a drop of these tables and views when the plugin is deleted, select the 
"Drop Tables/Views Upon Plugin Delete" option on the Rider Mileage Settings page.
**Warning:** all mileage data stored in these tables will be lost if you choose this option
and delete the plugin.
